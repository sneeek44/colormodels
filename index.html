        <h1>Differences between color representation models</h1>
        <h3>HEX</h3>
        <p>
            There are 3 basic colors from which subsequent colors are created. These are red (r), green (g) and blue (b). The HEX code consists
            of three values that indicate saturation. These values are written in hexadecimal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's take <b>#0000FF</b> as an example. Here the saturation of red and green is zero, and blue is maximally saturated.
            So we have just blue color, let's see below:
        </p>
        <div class="example" id="blue_rgb">
            #0000FF
        </div>
        <p>
            Everyone knows that if you mix red and green you get yellow. So, to get it, let’s substitute the maximum
             values in the first 4 characters, that is, F. The value of blue will be 00. By the way, we can shorten this entry: <b>#FFFF00</b>
             to <b>#FF0</b>, these are the same things, that is, the color parser will substitute F in the first two values, then in the next two, and the last
             the pair are filled with zeros. Let's check:
        </p>
        <div class="example" id="yellow_rgb">
            #FFFF00 / #FF0
        </div>


        <h3>RGB</h3>
        <p>
            Everything is almost the same as in HEX, only instead of hexadecimal system - now the color saturation is a number from 0 to 256.
            For example, #0000FF is the same as (0, 0, 256). The green color is (0, 256, 0):
        </p>
        <div class="example" id="green_rgb">
            (0, 256, 0)
        </div>

        <h3>HSL</h3>
        <p>
            HSL is formed from three parameters. Hue - hue, saturate - saturation, Lightness - brightness - hence the name, by the way.
             It's worth taking a look at <a href="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/8g/pu/fe/8gpufevs8kjhl22s8tdyfrqgzo0.png">color wheel</a>,
             to understand that the first parameter is the numeric value of the degree. It can be from 0 to 360, respectively. Saturation -
             this is the intensity of the color, calculated as a percentage, from 0 to 100. Brightness characterizes, well, the brightness of the color, and also from 0 to 100 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
            HSL is cool because it allows you to change color parameters separately. This is very convenient, and it’s quite possible to guess
             color only thanks to your brain. For example, green color: <b>hsl(120, 50%, 40%)</b>.
        </p>
        <div class="example" id="green_hsl">
            hsl(120, 50%, 40%)
        </div>
    </main>
    </div>
